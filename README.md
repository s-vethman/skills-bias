# skills-bias
Welcome!

In this repository, we provide the data and code to reproduce our work: "Gender imbalance on the job market reflected in biased skills ontologies".

Skills from ontologies ESCO and O\*NET are obtained from: https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/skill and https://www.onetcenter.org/. Accessed, 1st May 2020. 

Male employment ratios of each occupation is obtained from the US Labour Bureau of Statistics, https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2019/pdf/home.pdf.

All data is connected in file Final_data_connection.xlsx.

All data necessary to run the python script are ready as ESCO_EN, ONET_EN.

Running the script provides OUTPUT.csv's. 

To facilitate the creation of Figure 3, _job-average bias of skill sets related to the corresponding job's male employment ratio_, the simple R script can be utilized.

Results can be verified using the Final_results.xlsx.

Best,

Steven
