# Welcome!

**Introduction**
- In this repository, we provide the data and code to reproduce our work: "Gender imbalance on the job market reflected in biased skills ontologies".
- Currently submitting this paper.

**Origin of data**
- Skills from ontologies ESCO and O\*NET are obtained from: https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/skill and https://www.onetcenter.org/. Accessed, 1st May 2022. 
- Male employment ratios of each occupation is obtained from the US Labour Bureau of Statistics (USBLS), https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2019/pdf/home.pdf.

**Manual for reproduction**
- All data is connected in file USBLS_ONET_ESCO_LINK.xlsx.
- All data necessary to run the python script skills_bias_github.py are ready as ESCO_Skills.txt, ONET_skills.txt as tab-delimited files.
- Put these files in a data folder and check whether the filepaths function as desired in your current work directory.
- Running the script provides the output in a data folder.
- Python version 3.8 and see requirements.txt for package versions.
